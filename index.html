    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p class="about-me">Hey! My name is yasir, and I am pleased that you took the time to visit my website.

        Bold and ambitious, I usually dive headfirst into even the most challenging situations. Uncomplicated and direct in my approach, I often get frustrated by exhaustive details and unnecessary nuances. I lead with blind optimism, barreling through life with an electric "joie de vivre" that perfectly complements my distinctive impulsivity.
        
        I am an experienced JavaScript-based programmer, with a background in multi-drop delivery services, on-site surveying, and restaurant management. I possess strong communication, decision-making, and problem-solving skills to deliver great customer service, as well as excellent organizing and planning skills that enable adaptability and help to provide the first-class service and meet deadlines.</p>
